I gave up... UMMM I learned the TDD development. I just gave up on fixing the UI—I fucked up on saving DOM coordinates.  
But I believe I learned TDD fairly well, and I know my mistakes now, so I won't screw up next time...

I asked ChatGPT and BriGPT (LOL it's just Bri B) and they said I should just skip the fixed UI, but yeah—I learned the main concept and yeah LOL.
